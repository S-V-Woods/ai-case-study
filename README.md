## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
    *NVIDIA

* When was the company incorporated?
    Founded in 1993.

* Who are the founders of the company?
    *Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky founded NVIDIA.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  * While sitting in a Denny's

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    NVIDIA wants to streamline development generative AI applications with an end to end, cloud native software platform. GPUs offer a greater energy efficiency than CPUs so they are being used for AI training.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  NVIDIA's target audience are industry professionals who work with data and gamers. Over 40,000 companies use GPU's from NVIDIA for Ai and computing. As they broach into AI, many different industires use their AI technology. Automative vehicles use NVIDIA DRIVE, healthcare facilities use MONAI framework for imaging, and robotics developers use NVIDIA Jetson as a  platform for AI.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
* The use of GPUs changed the game of gaming and AI since it makes those fields more effiency.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
  * NVIDIA is a software and hardware compnay that ranges from semiconductors, APIs, AI, and high-performance computing.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
   * Semiconductors were able to double their performance every two years but that was coming to an end so chip developers had to change tactics, they had to develop 3D transistor structures. That way they were able to continue to grow and the innovations attached to them would not stagnate. When even that became hard to manage, companies made ultra-specific chips for specific tasks. Machine learning and AI created a market for semiconductor chips that could handle the workload.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
